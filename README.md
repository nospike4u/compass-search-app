# compass-search-app

## Description: 
The application aims to ease a very common organisational problem - "how can I find the right person with the right skills to do a particular job?" The Compass Search aims to create an easy to use interface that presents a user a number of ways to achieve their search goals. The first is via a classic search bar, the second is exploratory where search results are represented via nodes. The last is an artificial intelligence search to complement the other ways of searching.
